## Beginning üöÄ

_These instructions will allow you to get a copy of the project running on your local machine for
development and testing purposes._

See **Deployment** for how to deploy the project.

### Prerequisites üìã

_Develop the ERC721 Smart Contract With the OpenZeppelin Contract Wizard_

As said before, in this tutorial, you're going to use the OpenZeppelin Wizard to create the smart 
contract, for two main reasons:

    It‚Äôs secure.
    It offers standard smart contracts.

When it comes to writing smart contracts, security is key. There are tons of examples of smart contract 
exploits that have seen hundreds of millions of dollars stolen by malicious actors due to bad security.

You don‚Äôt want someone to steal all of your precious cryptos or NFTs once you‚Äôll deploy on the 
blockchain right?

OpenZeppelin serves this purpose, being one of the biggest maintainers of smart contract standards 
(ERC20, ERC721, etc), allowing developers to use thoroughly audited code to develop reliable contracts.

The first thing you'll need to do to develop our ERC721 NFT smart contract is to [go on the Open 
Zeppelin Smart contract wizard page](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/wizard).

Once on the page, you will see the following editor:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Click on the ERC721 button on the top left corner, to select the type of ERC standard to use and the 
kind of contract you want to write:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Now that you've selected the contract standard, on the left-hand side menu you should see a number of 
options:

Let‚Äôs start by choosing the name and the symbol of our Tokens. Click on the text box with ‚ÄúMyToken‚Äù and 
give it a name, do the same with the Symbol, and leave the base URI field blank (the token name will be 
used by OpenSea and Rarible as the name of the collection).

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Select the NFT (ERC721) Token Features_

Now you'll need to select the features that you want to integrate into our Smart contract, right after 
the settings section, you‚Äôll find the features section where you‚Äôll be able to select the different 
modules to include in your smart contract.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

In this case, you're going to select the following integrations:

    Mintable will create a mint function only callable by privileged accounts
    Autoincrement IDs will automatically assign incremental IDs to your NFTs
    Enumerable will give you access to on-chain Tokens enumeration and functions such as ‚ÄútotalSupply‚Äù, not present in the default ERC721 integration URI storage, to associate metadata and images to each of your NFTs
    URI Storage to be able to associate URIs to our NFTs

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

For the sake of this tutorial, and because you don‚Äôt want to create any kind of Tokenomic around our 
NFTs, leave the following modules unticked:

    Burnable - to burn tokens
    Pausable - to pause tokens transfers, sales, etc
    Votes - gives access to governance-like features like delegates and votes

If you want to learn more about these modules, check the official OpenZeppelin documentation about the 
ERC721 standard.

Now that you've selected the features you want, OpenZeppelin Wizard will populate the code of the Smart 
Contract, it should look as follow:

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.4;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";

contract Alchemy is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {
    constructor() ERC721("Alchemy", "ALC") {}

    function safeMint(address to, uint256 tokenId, string memory uri)
        public
        onlyOwner
    {
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
    }

    // The following functions are overrides required by Solidity.

    function _beforeTokenTransfer(address from, address to, uint256 tokenId)
        internal
        override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable)
    {
        super._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId);
    }

    function _burn(uint256 tokenId) internal override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage) {
        super._burn(tokenId);
    }

    function tokenURI(uint256 tokenId)
        public
        view
        override(ERC721, ERC721URIStorage)
        returns (string memory)
    {
        return super.tokenURI(tokenId);
    }

    function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceId)
        public
        view
        override(ERC721, ERC721Enumerable)
        returns (bool)
    {
        return super.supportsInterface(interfaceId);
    }
}
```
It‚Äôs time to copy our code and bring it on Remix IDE to modify and deploy it on the Blockchain.


### Instalation üîß

_Modify and Deploy your ERC721 contract with REMIX IDE_

Now that you have your ERC721 smart contract, let's modify, and deploy it on the Goerli Testnet. To do 
so, you'll use Remix IDE, a free and web-based integrated development environment specifically designed 
for smart contract development with Solidity.

First of all, as you might have noticed, on top of the OpenZeppelin Wizard editor, there‚Äôs the button 
‚ÄúOpen in Remix‚Äù:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Clicking on it will open REMIX IDE in a new tab of your browser.

_Using Remix to Modify the NFT Smart Contract_

Starting from the top of the contract, there's the ‚ÄúSPDX-License-Identifier‚Äù that specifies the type of 
license your code will be published under - it‚Äôs good practice in web3 applications to keep the code 
open source as it will ensure trustworthiness.

```
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
```

Then there's the pragma - the version of the compiler you'll want to use to compile the smart contract 
code. The little ‚Äú^‚Äù symbol, tells the compiler that every version between 0.8.0 to 0.8.9 is suitable 
to compile our code.

```
pragma solidity ^0.8.17;
```

Then we're importing a bunch of libraries and initializing the smart contract.

```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721Enumerable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC721/extensions/ERC721URIStorage.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/Counters.sol";
```

We're then initializing the contract, inheriting from all the standards we're importing from the OpenZeppelin repository:

```
contract Alchemy is ERC721, ERC721Enumerable, ERC721URIStorage, Ownable {...}
```

As you can notice, the safeMint function has the ‚Äúonly owner‚Äù modifier - this will allow only the owner 
of the smart contract (the wallet address that deployed the smart contract) to mint NFTs. Chances are 
you want anyone to mint NFTs, to do so you'll need to remove the onlyOwner modifier from the Mint 
function.

```
function safeMint(address to, string memory uri) public {
        uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current();
        _tokenIdCounter.increment();
        _safeMint(to, tokenId);
        _setTokenURI(tokenId, uri);
    }
```

You can also remove it from the contract declaration "Ownable", and the library imports

```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/access/Ownable.sol";
```

Now that everyone will be able to mint our NFTs, you'll need to avoid people from minting more NFTs than the max number of NFTs in 
our collection. To do so let's specify the max number of mintable NFTs.

Let‚Äôs say want the users to be able to mint up to a total of 10,000 NFTs. To do so, let‚Äôs create a new uint256 variable, call it 
MAX_SUPPLY, and assign it 10,000.

```
Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter;
    uint256 MAX_SUPPLY = 100000;

    constructor() ERC721("Alchemy", "ALCH") {}
```

Next, let‚Äôs move into the safeMint function and add a require statement on line 18:

```
require(_tokenIdCounter.current() <= MAX_SUPPLY, "I'm sorry we reached the cap");
```

Let's spend a couple of words to better understand what is the "require" statement in Solidity.

You can read more about the Solidity "require" statement, in the official documentation.

Now that you've limited the max supply of our NFTs, is time to compile the smart contract and deploy it on the Goerli Testnet. To 
do so, you'll need to create a free account on [Alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com/?a=roadtoweb3weekone), add it as a node provider 
on Metamask, and get some [free Goerli ETH](https://goerlifaucet.com/).

_Create a Free Alchemy Account_

First of all, let's need to navigate to [Alchemy.com](https://alchemy.com/?a=roadtoweb3weekone) click on ‚ÄúLogin‚Äù and create a new 
account:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Select the Ethereum ecosystem:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Give your application app and team a name, choose the Goerli network and click on create App:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Once you'll have completed the onboarding process, we'll be redirected to the dashboard. Click on the application with the name 
you decided, in this case, ‚Äútest‚Äù, click on the ‚ÄúVIEW KEY‚Äù button on the top right corner, and copy the HTTP URL:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Next, you'll need to add Alchemy to Metamask as a Goerli RPC Provider. If you don‚Äôt have Metamask installed, make sure to follow 
this guide to add it to your browser and create a new wallet.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

You'll be redirected to the following page, where you'll need to fill in the Goerli Network and RPC URL info.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Add the following information to the form:

    Network name: Alchemy Goerli
    New RPC URL: the HTTP URL of the Goerli Alchemy Application
    Chain ID: 5
    Currency Symbol: GoerliETH
    Block Explorer: https://goerli.etherscan.io

Amazing, you just added Goerli to Metamask, using Alchemy! üéâ

It‚Äôs now time to deploy our Smart Contract on Goerli, but first, you'll need to get some Goerli Test ETH.

_Get Free Goerli Test ETH_

Getting Goerli Test ETH is super simple, just navigate to [goerlifaucet.com](https://goerlifaucet.com/), copy the wallet address 
into the text bar, and click on ‚ÄúSend Me ETH‚Äù:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

After 10-20 seconds you'll see the Goerli ETH appearing in the Metamask Wallet.

You'll be able to get up to 0.1 ETH every 24 without logging in, or 0.5 with an Alchemy account.

Now that you have the test ETH, it‚Äôs time to compile and deploy our NFT smart contract on the blockchain.

_Compile and Deploy the NFT Smart Contract on the Goerli Testnet_

Back to Remix, let‚Äôs click on the compiler menu on the left-hand side of the page and click on The blue ‚ÄúCompile‚Äù button:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Then click on the ‚ÄúDeploy and Run Transactions menu, click on the Environment dropdown menu and select ‚Äúinjected Web3‚Äù:

Make sure the Metamask wallet is on the Alchemy Goerli network, select the NFT Smart contract from the Contract dropdown menu, and 
click on Deploy.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

A Metamask pop-up window will appear, click on "sign", and proceed to pay the gas fees.

If everything worked as expected, after 10 seconds you should see the contract listed under Deployed Contracts:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Now that the Smart contract is deployed on the Goerli testnet, it‚Äôs time to mint our NFTs, but first, you'll need to create and 
upload the metadata on IPFS, let‚Äôs understand what we mean by the term ‚Äúmetadata‚Äù.

_What is NFTs Metadata?_

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

For OpenSea to pull in off-chain metadata for ERC721 tokens, the contract will need to return a URI pointing to the hosted 
metadata. To find this URI, OpenSea, Rarible and other popular marketplaces will use the tokenURI method contained in the 
ERC721Uristorage standard.

The tokenURI function in the ERC721 should return an HTTP or IPFS URL, such as ipfs://
bafkreig4rdq3nvyg2yra5x363gdo4xtbcfjlhshw63we7vtlldyyvwagbq. When queried, this URL should return a JSON blob of data with the 
metadata for your token.

You can read more about [metadata standards on the official OpenSea documentation](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/
metadata-standards).

_How to Format Your NFT Metadata_

According to the OpenSea documentation, the NFT Metadata should be stored in a .json file and structured as follow:

```
{ 
  "description": "YOUR DESCRIPTION",
  "external_url": "YOUR URL",
  "image": "IMAGE URL",
  "name": "TITLE", 
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Base", 
      "value": "Starfish"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Eyes", 
      "value": "Big"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Mouth", 
      "value": "Surprised"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Level", 
      "value": 5
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Stamina", 
      "value": 1.4
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Personality", 
      "value": "Sad"
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "boost_number", 
      "trait_type": "Aqua Power", 
      "value": 40
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "boost_percentage", 
      "trait_type": "Stamina Increase", 
      "value": 10
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "number", 
      "trait_type": "Generation", 
      "value": 2
    }]
  }
```

Here's a brief explanation of what each property stores:

Property	Explanation
* image: This is the URL to the image of the item. Can be just about any type of image (including SVGs, which will be cached into 
PNGs by OpenSea), and can be IPFS URLs or paths. We recommend using a 350 x 350 image.
* image_data: Raw SVG image data, if you want to generate images on the fly (not recommended). Only use this if you're not 
including the image parameter.
* external_url:	This is the URL that will appear below the asset's image on OpenSea and will allow users to leave OpenSea and view 
the item on your site.
* description:	A human-readable description of the item. Markdown is supported.
* name:	Name of the item
* attributes:	These are the attributes for the item, which will show up on the OpenSea page for the item. (see below)
* background_color:	Background color of the item on OpenSea. Must be six-character hexadecimal without a pre-pended
* animation_url:	A URL to a multi-media attachment for the item. The file extensions GLTF, GLB, WEBM, MP4, M4V, OGV, and OGG are 
supported, along with the audio-only extensions MP3, WAV, and OGA. Animation_url also supports HTML pages, allowing us to build 
rich experiences and interactive NFTs using JavaScript canvas, WebGL, and more. Scripts and relative paths within the HTML page 
are now supported. However, access to browser extensions is not supported. youtube_url A URL to a YouTube video

Now that we have a brief understanding of what will be contained in your tokens metadata, let's learn how to create it and store 
it on IPFS.

Creating and Uploading the Metadata on IPFS

First of all, navigate to [filebase.com](https://filebase.com/) and create a new account.

Once logged in, click on the bucket button on the left-hand side menu, and create a new bucket:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Navigate into the bucket, click on the upload button, and upload the image you want to use for your NFT, I‚Äôll use the following.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Once uploaded click on it and copy the IPFS Gateway URL:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Using any text editor, paste the following JSON code:

```
{ 
  "description": "This NFT proves I've created and deployed my first ERC20 smart contract on Goerli with Alchemy Road to Web3",
  "external_url": "Alchemy.com/?a=roadtoweb3weekone",
  "image": "https://ipfs.filebase.io/ipfs/bafybeihyvhgbcov2nmvbnveunoodokme5eb42uekrqowxdennt2qyeculm",
  "name": "A cool NFT", 
  "attributes": [
    {
      "trait_type": "Base", 
      "value": "Starfish"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Eyes", 
      "value": "Big"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Mouth", 
      "value": "Surprised"
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Level", 
      "value": 5
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Stamina", 
      "value": 1.4
    }, 
    {
      "trait_type": "Personality", 
      "value": "Sad"
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "boost_number", 
      "trait_type": "Aqua Power", 
      "value": 40
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "boost_percentage", 
      "trait_type": "Stamina Increase", 
      "value": 10
    }, 
    {
      "display_type": "number", 
      "trait_type": "Generation", 
      "value": 2
    }]
  }
```

And save the file as "metadata.json". Move back to Filebase and upload the metadata.json file in the same bucket where we uploaded 
the Image.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

_Mint Your Goerli NFT_

Go back to Remix and in the Deploy & Run Transactions menu, go under ‚Äúdeployed contracts‚Äù - and click on the contract we just 
deployed, it will open up a list of all the methods contained in your Smart contact:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Orange methods are methods that actually write on the blockchain whereas Blue methods are methods learning from the blockchain.

Click on the safeMint method dropdown icon and paste your address and the following string into the uri field:

```
ipfs://\<your\_metadata\_cid>
```

Clicking on transact will create a Metamask popup prompting you to pay the gas fees.

Click on "sign" and go on minting your first NFT!

Wait a couple of seconds and, to make sure the mint went through successfully, copy and paste your address in the balanceOf method 
input, and run it - it should show you have 1 NFT.

Do the same with the tokenUri method, inserting ‚Äú0‚Äù as the id argument - it should display your tokenURI.

Great! You just minted your first NFT! üéâ

Now it‚Äôs time to move to OpenSea to check if the metadata is benign read.

_Visualize Your NFT on OpenSea_

Navigate to [testnets.opensea.io](https://testnets.opensea.io/) and log in with your Metamask wallet. Then click on your profile 
picture, you should see your newly minted NFT there. If the image is not yet visible, click on it, and click on the ‚Äúrefresh 
metadata‚Äù button.

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Sometimes OpenSea has hard times recognizing testnet metadata - and could take up to 6 hours to see it. After some time your NFT 
should be visible as follow:

![Alt text](https://www.github.com/assets.digitalocean.com/articles/alligator/boo.svg "a title")

Congratulations, you have successfully created, modified, and deployed your first smart contract. Minted your first NFT, and 
published your image on IPFS! üî•
